### ðŸ“Œ NIH Small Dataset

#### Modifications to original data(Version 1)
=> We have modified the original dataset by selecting only 9 specific lung diseases. This targeted approach allows for a more detailed and accurate classification and detection system.
There are 10classes(9 diseases, and one for "No Findings")


Here is **[Rapid CXR Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/seoyunje/rapid-cxr-dataset)**

There are no multi Label

  ## Pad Chest Dataset 
  Of these reports, 27% were manually annotated by trained physicians and the remaining set was labeled using a supervised method based on a recurrent neural network with attention mechanisms.
