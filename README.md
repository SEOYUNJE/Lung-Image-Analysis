ðŸ“Œ **Chest X-Ray Lung Disease Classification with Grad-CAM Localization**

=> This task involves `classifying lung diseases` using chest X-ray images and highlighting the affected regions using `Grad-CAM` (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping).

## Overview
The detection and classification of diseases from Chest X-ray (CXR) images is a crucial task in medical diagnostics, enabling timely and accurate identification of various thoracic conditions. This project aims to leverage advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect and classify distinct diseases from CXR images.

> **Custom Data**

  => [NIH Big Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/seoyunje/nih-big-dataset)
  
   #### Modifications to original data 
   - We just only select No Finding, Edema, Atelectasis, Pneumonia, Effusion, Pneumothorax, Emphysema, Consolidation, Fibrosis 

   - To address the issue of data imbalance, We selected only 10,000 cases of "No Finding."
   
   - In the given NIH dataset, the labels generated by the RNN sometimes incorrectly indicate diseases. Therefore, if a patient has multiple diseases, any instance labeled as "No Finding" is removed in such cases.

   - Due to the differences in lung structure between children and adults, images of adolescents under the age of 16 were not included
   #### Introduce of custom data 
   
   - There are only `10` Diseases in custom datasets
   
   - There are `29,884` images(format: png, 1024x1024) in custom datasets
   
   - There are `11,016` AP View in custom datasets
   
   - There are `18,868` PA View in custom datasets
   
   - There are `14,939` Patient IDs in custom datasets
